# Advent of Code 2016 solutions

This repository contains solutions to the [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016) 
advent calendar.

All solutions are in Scala.

## Warning

The solutions should not be viewed as idiomatic code or even good code 
at all. They are mainly written to solve the problem at hand, and as a way
to increase my familiarity with Scala.
